				<h2> Kini-ing </h2>
				<h3>Benguet</h3>
				<p>"Kini-ing" is a preserved meat, originally pork, that undergoes smoking using pine wood. The meat is hanged above the fire used in cooking at a traditional kitchen that uses wood for three to four days.
Such a process of preservation has been practiced by several villages in the Cordillera as a means of preserving the meat from butchered animals, making them last for many months, ready for the rainy season.
The Cordillera adapts meat preservation which is all part of the native delicacy. Whether it is "Kini-ing", "etag" or "kinuday", they all come in pork, which is a "necessity" during gatherings.</p>

				<h2> Etag </h2>
				<h3>Mountain Povince</h3>
				<p>Etag is the general term used in Cordillera about the native’s traditional way or preserving pork. A slab of a big slice of pork is cured in salt for about a week (or longer) then air dried under the sun or smoked for several weeks (even months), or both.
