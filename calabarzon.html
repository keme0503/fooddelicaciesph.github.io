				<h2> Bulalo </h2>
				<h3>Pueblo de Oro, Batangas</h3>
				<p>Bulalo seems relatively simple to cook. Its main and most distinct ingredient is beef shanks simmered for several hours in a flavorful stock seasoned with black pepper, garlic, onions, and salt. The dish typically comes with pechay (Chinese cabbage), potatoes, and even corn.

You’ll know the rich bowl of bulalo soup you have in front of you is genuine when the unmistakably tender meat starts falling off the bones. 
Pair the dish with a sauce made out of patis (fish sauce), calamansi, and chili and it’s heaven on a plate.</p>
