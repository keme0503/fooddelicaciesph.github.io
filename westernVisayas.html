				<h2> BINAKOE/BINAKUL </h2>
				<h3>Malay, Aklan</h3>
				<p>Traditional binakoe is cooked inside a fresh node of bamboo. Native chicken plus onions and lemongrass are added. For the souring agent, aeabihig leaves complete the mix. Think of this dish as similar to the sinigang and might appeal to Tagalog palates.

				A hot plate of rice plus steaming binakoe then paired with an ice cold soda would be the perfect lunch!</p>

				<h3>Kalibo, Aklan</h3>
				<p>Linapay is the Aklanon ‘laing’ pounded small shrimps (not alamang) seasoned with garlic, onion, ginger, chili, and tender ‘batwan’ fruit wrapped in young ‘gabi’ leaves and cooked in coconut milk.

				<h2> Linapwahan </h2>
				<h3>Tibiao, Antique</h3>
				<p>it is a Filipino dish prepared with a different mix of vegetables and the most popular ones are moringa (malunggay leaves), drumsticks (malunggay fruit), green papaya, jute leaves (saluyot), okra, Malabar spinach (alugbati), squash, string beans, bitter gourd (ampalaya), eggplant and spinach. 
				It is then flavoured with ginamus / fermented anchovy sauce plus some seafood in the form of fresh water shrimps (orang), river crabs (kalampay), dried shrimp fry (kalkag), dried anchovies (baog) and/or dried fish (pinakas). 
				All of these wonderful ingredients are then boiled simply in water with tomatoes and onions and trust me it creates this wonderful vegetable stew that is slightly sweet, rich and tons of umami.

				<h2> ADOBONG TAKLONG (FOREST SNAILS)</h2>
				<h3>President Roxas, Capiz</h3>
				<p>Taklong is a species of snail found in the woods or forested areas in Capiz and nearby provinces, mostly in moist places near rivers and waterfalls. Locals prepared this dish and served it during our kamayan-style picnic lunch at Liktinon Falls in Brgy. Bayuyan, President Roxas (along with more tame offerings like liempo & steamed crab). When cooked, the cut up pieces of snail meat resembled chicken gizzard or mussels.</p>

				<h2> La Paz Batchoy</h2>
				<h3>Iloilo City, Iloilo</h3>
				<p>This steaming bowl of savory noodle soup was supposedly made of meat parts vendors weren’t able to sell that day. 
				This explains why it contains a hodgepodge of ingredients, like bits of pork liver, pork intestines, thin beef slices, and bone marrow, all cooked in a robust pork and beef broth then garnished with egg, crushed chicharon, scallions, fried garlic, and even bagoong (guinamos in Hiligaynon). </p>

				<h2> Piaya</h2>
				<h3>Bacolod, Negros Occidental</h3>
				<p>The original crispy piaya is not quite the same as the piaya you'll find on supermarket shelves. Traditional piaya is a simple but tasty treat made of flour and muscovado (unrefined sugar).
				It is much thinner, almost wafer-like, and coated with just the right amount of muscovado.
