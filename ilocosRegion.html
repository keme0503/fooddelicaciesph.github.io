				<h2> Empanada </h2>
				<h3>Ilocos Norte</h3>
				<p>Empanada is a popular pastry filled with either sweet or savory fillings. The Ilocos empanada founded in the City of Batac, Ilocos Norte. Batac empanada has an orange hue from the atsuete coloring and uses longganisa, it is a signature food of Ilocos Norte. The name empanada is derived from Spanish word meaning to wrap and coat in bread and this is the most popular street fare in Batac City, Ilocos Norte. The city is famous for the Batac Empanadas which are considered some of the best country. there is even Empanada festival that takes place every year on the 23rd of June. One of the most striking characteristics of the Batac empanada is its bright orange color. the empanada is deep fried and stuffed with green papaya, chopped up longganisa sausages and hard boiled eggs. The orange colored dough is made of rice flour and the color comes from the use of annatto seeds. These empanada are quite tasty and very different from the ones in Argentina. You;re not going to regret if you taste the empanada Batac.</p>

				<h2> Bagnet </h2>

				<h2> Pigar-pigar </h2>
				<h3>Pangasinan</h3>
				<p>Pigar-pigar is thin beef slices sauteed in onions and cabbage. It is a popular pulutan in Dagupan City, Pangasinan. It is also commonly served on top of hot rice. Because of its light seasoning, it is usually served with a dipping sauce of fresh chili, calamansi juice and soy sauce.It’s oily, beefy, saucy and delicious all at the same time. In my opinion, the best pigar-pigar in Dagupan can be tasted in Puzon’s Pigar-pigar, located along the highway of Lucao District.</p>
