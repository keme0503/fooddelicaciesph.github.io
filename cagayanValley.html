				<h2> Luñis </h2>
				<h3>Basco Batanes</h3>
				<p>This is a different version of the popular Filipino dish, adobo, because luñis is rather served dry.
				Lasting for quite a while, this traditional dish is made of pork cooked with rock salt until its fat is rendered and it turns golden brown. Back in the old days, it is stored in its own lard in jars for months to ensure continuous supply.
				To best eat luñis, I love to pair it with supas whilst dipping it in vinegar and garlic!</p>

				<h2> Vunes </h2>
				<h3>Batanes</h3>
				<p>This is a dish that my father used to prepare a lot for our family (he cooks it real good!). This is made of  preserved gabi (taro) stalks which could technically last for years.

As a typical Batanes food, the gabi stalks are first soaked in water. Afterwards, it will be cut and minced and then cooked together with pork and patola (or sponge gourd).

You could surely think of it as another version of laing, a Bicol specialty in the Philippines.</p>			</div>

				<h2> Pancit Cabagan </h2>
				<h3>Cagayan</h3>
				<p>Pancit Cabagan. Another variety of pancit, it has no such elaborate toppings like that of pancit batil patong. There is a mixture of vegetables and of course, I like the spicy condiment. 
				
				What is noteworthy of pancit cabagan is the serving size. In Cagayan, when you say pancit, it is of no ordinary serving but expect a bigger serving. One serving is equivalent to two or three pancit servings in Metro Manila.
				Pancit Cabagan is said to have been introduced by a Chinese settler in the town of Cabagan in nearby Isabela province. It looks Chinese enough. The wet pancit has round noodles, julienned cabbage and carrots, boiled quail eggs and a generous heap of lechon de carajay slices. 
				It comes with the sweeter white onions, calamansi and egg drop soup.

				<h2> Binalay</h2>
				<h3>Iligan Isabela</h3>
				<p>This Filipino kakanin Binalay is a native delicacy of Iligan, Isabela province. A sticky rice dessert dipped in sweet buttery syrup sprinkled with latik bits. Super delicious and sweet. 
				Binalay is a native suman delicacy of the province made of sticky rice flour and wrapped in banana leaves. Binallay is cooked in boiling water until done then serve with latik sauce.

				<h2> Batil Patung </h2>
				<h3>Tuguegarao</h3>
				<p>Batil Patung is a Tuguegarao original. Batil means mix and patung means top or topping. The noodles in Batil Patung are the flat kind. The topping consists of sautéed beef or, I guess, carabeef, bean sprouts, sliced leeks, julienned carrots, crushed chicharon, meat loaf slices and fried egg. 
				It comes with a cup of egg drop soup meant to be sipped or mixed with the pancit. 
				Chopped red onions, calamansi and chili peppers are also served.</p>

				<h2> Buko Pancit </h2>
				<h3>Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya</h3>
				<p>As their trademark buko pie they came up with the idea of a buko pancit. Pancit buko (Tagalog "young coconut noodles"; also known as pancit butong in Visayan), is a Filipino dish made from very thin strips of young coconut (buko) meat with various spices, vegetables, and meat or seafood. 
				It is a type of Filipino noodle dish (pancit), even though it does not usually use actual noodles. 
				The recipes can vary and are often adaptations of other Filipino pancit dishes. It has two main types, a broth version, and a stir-fried (guisado) version. The latter often uses latik and coconut oil derived from coconut cream (kakang gata). Pancit buko is commonly served directly on an opened coconut shell. </p>
