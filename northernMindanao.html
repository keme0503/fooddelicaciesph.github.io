				<h2> Sinuglaw </h2>
				<h3>Northern Mindanao</h3>
				<p>Sinuglaw is a mix of sinugba and kinilaw – two dishes common in Filipino palate.
			Sinugba is grilled pork belly while kinilaw (ceviche-style) is raw fish, usually tuna, soaked in a cocktail of vinegar and citrus juices. The kinilaw in Mindanao is unique because of the suwa and tabon-tabon included in the mix. 
			Tabon-tabon is a tropical fruit that grows in the wilderness of Mindanao, that looks like the more familiar chico.</p>

				<h2>Binaki (Sweet Tamales) </h2>
				<h3>Bukidnon</h3>
				<p>Binaki is a kakanin from Bukidnon. It comes from the word “baki” which means frog. The delicacy may have caught its name due to its appearance. When the binaki is ready to eat, it is wrapped in corn husk and folded in the shape of a frog.
				The delicacy is made from ground corn and mixed with the usual ingredients for baking - milk, sugar, baking powder, eggs, and salt. The corn husks are soaked beforehand and steamed for an hour, so it’s ready-to-use once the mixture cools.</p>
