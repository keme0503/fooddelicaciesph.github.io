				<h2> Boneless Crispy Pata </h2>
				<h3>Davao del Sur Province</h3>
				<p>Crispy pata is one of the most popular dishes to order while dining in Davao. This whole, deboned pork leg is simmered in spices and deep fried to perfection. On first bite there’s a deep crackling that echoes and is closely similar to the texture and crisp of a roast pork here in Singapore.
				This delicious and indulgent dish takes quite an arduous process to prepare yet remains tender and well-seasoned throughout.</p>

				<h2>Durian and Langka Turon </h2>
				<h3>Davao City</h3>
				<p>This yummy deep fried dessert is a must-try dish when you’re in Davao. We tried this while dining at Rekado Comfort Cuisine, and the spread at this restaurant is indescribably good. The Durian-Langka (jackfruit) Turon is deep fried in lumpia wrapper, and plated in a traditional iron. Also comes with a serving of tablea chocolate dipping sauce.</p>

				<h2> Kalderobo</h2>
				<h3>Davao City</h3>
				<p>Homemade adobo or kalderobo is one of their signatures in davao,

they use beef instead of chicken, and the meat is really tender with each bite. Sauce-wise it’s

not as thick as we prefer but extremely tasty nonetheless.

				<h2> Filipino-style Fried Fish with Mango Sauce </h2>
				<h3>Samal Island, Davao City</h3>
				<p>Besides the sandy beaches, blue waters and aesthetically pleasing resort front, the food here is an absolute must-try. We had a seafood feast and
				everything on the table was delicious. Our favourite is the Filipino-style fried fish with mango sauce – simple but dripping with sweet and savoury flavours. </p>
