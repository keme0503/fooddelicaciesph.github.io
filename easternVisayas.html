				<h2> Tamalos </h2>
				<h3>Catbalogan City</h3>
				<p>A fragrant aroma rises along with the steam as you unwrap the banana leaves. The thick peanut sauce glistens revealing slabs of pork belly and slivers of pork fat underneath laid on soft rice flour. The dark and creamy peanut sauce delivers a refreshing sweetness capped by a soothing heat from the chili, so flavorful almost like a traditional kare-kare. 
				But its the fork tender pork belly and pork fat that just makes this dish special. The blend of savory pork and the equally rich peanut sauce is a perfect match, with the soft rice completing the dish. It's comforting and satisfying, a meal in itself.</p>
