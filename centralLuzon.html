				<h2> Sinampalukang Manok </h2>
				<h3>Gapan, Nueva Ecija</h3>
				<p>Sinampalukang Manok is perhaps the most under-rated Filipino dish of all time. It’s the perfect soup for these rainy december days when all you crave for is a nice sour broth that washes off the palate. This dish’s name is taken from the use of the sampaloc (hence the word sinampalukan, which literally means infused with tamarind) in flavoring the soup—a popular method in making sinigang, the Philippine sour soup. 
				You can say the sinampalukang manok is the chicken version of sinigang, which commonly uses proteins such as pork, fish and shrimp. As to how they are different baffles me. For now, the only difference I see is in the sinampalukang manok’s use of tamarind leaves which gives off a really lovely aroma on top of the tamarind broth. 
				This is a common dish in Gapan and one thing that makes this unique from other dishes. The use native chicken for the meat.

				<p>Baler’s suman compare to the typical ones or even those in Antipolo. Suman is glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk and wrapped in buri palm leaves.
