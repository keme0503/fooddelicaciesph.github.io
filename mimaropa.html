				<h2> Bibingkang Lalaki </h2>
				<h3>Boac, Marinduque</h3>
				<p>Ask any of the vendors in the Boac public market why their heavy snack is called ‘bibingkang lalaki’ (male bibingka), and they’ll giggle before telling you: “May itlog kasi, eh.”

				Coconuts and their by-products are a main source of income in Marinduque. This carries over to the food. Bibingkang lalaki is made with tuba (coconut wine) instead of yeast, which keeps the inside of the bibingka moist and pudding-like.</p>

				<h2> Adobong pugita</h2>
				<h3>Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro</h3>
				<p>Adobong pugita is a Filipino specialty originating from Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro. This adobo dish is made with mature octopus that's cooked in a combination of vinegar and soy sauce. Other common ingredients include garlic, onions, oil, and bay leaves for flavoring.

The octopus is marinated, drained, then placed into a pan with sautéed garlic and onions. The dish is seasoned with salt and pepper and it's then traditionally served warm with steamed rice on the side. The key to success is to cook the octopus quickly, because it becomes rubbery and chewy if overcooked.

				<h2> Ginataang Langka</h2>
				<h3>Romblon</h3>
				<p>the Filipino word ‘langka’ refers to jackfruit. For this dish, the unripe jackfruit is used. ‘Ginataan,’ on the other hand, refers to any dish cooked with coconut milk. Coconut is among the top produce in the province of Romblon. 
				So, coconut milk is often used in Romblon as one of the main ingredients in their dishes like this Ginataang Langka. Aside from the unripe jackfruit and coconut milk, Ginataang Langka also has daing (salted and dried fish) and red chili peppers. The dish has a subtle bitter taste coming from Lumbay leaves, a rare leaf that may only be found in Indonesia and the Philippines. 
				Its contrasting layers of flavors and the meat texture of the langka plus the aroma from the coconut milk are just glorious especially when served with warm rice. </p>
