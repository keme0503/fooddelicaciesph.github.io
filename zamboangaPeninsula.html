				<h2>Curacha </h2>
				<h3>zamboanga sibugay</h3>
				<p>Curacha is definitely on the top of the list of must-try eats in Zamboanga. The Chavacano name is derived from the phrase “cockroach of the sea”. 
				This crustacean is abundant in the waters of Zamboanga, and looks like a hybrid of a crab and a lobster. The dish is prepared with a special sauce made from coconut milk and a few secret spices.</p>

				<h2> Chupa Culo </h2>
				<h3>Sta. Cruz Island</h3>
				<p>Chupa Culo is a must-try if you’re adventurous with food. Its name comes from the Spanish terms chupa = to suck, and culo =  behind. This dish is made of black snails cooked in coconut milk and pako (fiddlehead fern). The meat is kept inside the shell to soak up all the flavor of the sauce. The best (and only) way to eat this is to suck the meat out of the shell, hence the name.

				<h2> Satti</h2>
				<h3>Zamboanga Sibugay</h3>
				<p>Satti is similar to the satay dish of Malaysia and Indonesia (grilled beef or chicken skewer with peanut sauce). This dish, on the other hand, has a sweet red sauce. It’s a typical breakfast food for the residents of Zamboanga City, eaten with rice cooked in coconut leaves or puso. 
				Joints that serve this dish open as early as 3 a.m. to serve the early birds.

				<h2> Tiulah Itum </h2>
				<h3>Zamboanga City</h3>
				<p>One dish that is a local favorite in Zamboanga is called Tiula Itum. “Itum” means black, and that is what the dish actually is: a black soup or broth. It is served hot and spicy, and the hotter and spicier, the better. The broth is made from beef or chicken that is flavored with ginger, turmeric, and burned coconut meat. 
				This dish is served in many occassions: during weddings, religious festivities, and other celebrations. The Tiula Itum is a Tausug dish but it is one of the most popular dishes in Zamboanga del Sur. </p>

				<h2> Kurma</h2>
				<h3>Zamboanga City</h3>
				<p>Kurma is a popular dish in the city. It is the local version of curry. My helping of kurma had the best texture and just the right amount of spice, probably caused by the careful braising of the meat in coconut milk during the dish’s preparation.</p>

				<h2>Ensalada Chamba</h2>
				<h3>Upper Calarian, Zamboanga City</h3>
				<p>A flavorful blend of smoky grilled eggplant, mango, and salted egg, the Ensalada Chamba is a dish I could eat at any time of the day. The sweetness of the diced mangoes blended the flavors of the dish so well.
